# SQL injections
## Difference between blind SQL injection
- doesn't print out information from the database **directly**
	- doesn't print out which error occurred
	- prints out only if the user exists ![[SQL blind injection vs normal.png]]
## Mitigation
- don't feed what the user inputs directly into an SQL query
