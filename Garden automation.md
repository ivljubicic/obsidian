## Cost projection
- camera
- electronics
	- battery for each module
		- make it solar powered
		- extra cost
	- automation of a hose
- casing

## Server
- run on a raspberry pi and everything placed on the same network
	- create a new network that just contains the IoT devices
- test to get from the outside
- strengthen the WIFI password

### Concurrency
- see if i could handle all the request in parallel
	- test out Go, Rust, Node.js and Python for parallelization

## Website
- possible solutions
