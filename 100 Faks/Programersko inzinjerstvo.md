# Using a model that represents the final product
- the key characteristics of a model
	- is abstract
		- doesn't tell you everything about a final product
	 	- tells you just enough that you can **understand the key things** about the final product
	- it must be easy to read and provide information about possible questions we may have about the model 

# Model driven software development
- the key idea is to develop the **abstract model into the final product** 
- how to better develop a software product
	- make **procedures**
	- documentation of every phase
	- analyze different architecture and solutions
	- **smaller chunks of code**
	- implement **format tests**
