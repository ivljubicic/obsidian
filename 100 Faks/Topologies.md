# Nodes
- things like repeaters, bridges, switches, routers
- connection points of the transmission medium(the wires)

# Routing and connections
- connections are physical based
- routing is something logical

# Types of structures
## Point to point
- not the same as the P2P architecture
## Bus
- everyone shares the transmission medium
## Star
- central network component 
	- handles the forwarding function for the data packets
	- all the data go through it
## Ring
- incoming/outgoing

## Mesh
### Fully meshed
- every host connected to one another
- used in WAN and MAN
	- ensures high bandwidth and reliability
- routers are networked together
### Partially meshed
- the endpoints are connected by only one connection
