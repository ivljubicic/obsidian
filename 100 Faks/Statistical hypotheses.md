# Statistical hypotheses
- can concern one or more populations
- a hypothesis is **rejected** when there is **a small probability of obtaining the sample information** 


## The null and alternative hypothesis
-  the null hypothesis is that one **we are trying to prove**
	-  if its false we **accept the alternative hypothesis**
-  either **reject $H_0$ because of sufficient evidence** or **fail to reject because of insufficient evidence**

### Critical value
- some number arbitrarily chosen
- it represents an inflection point for $H_0$ and $H_1$
- all **values grater than the critical value** represent **the critical region**

 ### Errors and level of significance
 - level of significance $\alpha$
	 - **the probability of committing a type 1 error**
 - type 1
	 - rejection when it is true
	 - what is the probability that **our X is grater from our critical value for a given $p$**
 - type 2
	 - non rejection when it is false
	 - we choose are own p when calculating the probability of committing a type II error $\beta$
		 - i.e. p=0.7 the new vaccine is significantly superior

### Power of test
- the probability of rejecting $H_0$
