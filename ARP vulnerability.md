# ARP vulnerability
- doesn't have any mechanisms for authentication
- you can send and ARP datagram before the actual intended sender
	- leads to traffic redirection
	- MitM attack setup
- MitM ARP attack on a network MitM ARP attack on a network![[MitM ARP attack on a network.png]]
	- reply to the PC 
		- the attacker tells that the **router MAC address** is his own
	- reply to the router
		- the attacker tells that the **PC MAC address** is his own
## ARP vulnerability mitigation
- printing out the ARP cache
	- if the MAC address for an IP address changed, it is likely that a MitM attack occurred
- using switches with **port security**
